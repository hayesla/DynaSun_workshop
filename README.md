# SunPy tutorial for the DynaSun workshop 2024

This is a repository that holds the tutorial about using SunPy at the [DynaSun workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/dynasun2024/overview?authuser=1) that was held at Northumbria Univeristy in September 2024.

In this jupyter notebook, we go over some introductory aspects of sunpy to highlight the main functionality availability in the sunpy core package, and show an example of how to extract a kink oscillation in a time-distance plot of a loop observed in AIA 171 angstrom. 

You can run this notebook locally by downloading it (i.e. `git clone https://github.com/hayesla/DynaSun_workshop.git`) and installing the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.
You will also need to install jupyter lab.
